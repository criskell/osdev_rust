# osdev_rust

A toy operating system developed in Rust for hobby and study purposes. The main idea is to work using existing crates, such as `linked_list_allocator`, to later create my own solutions in the areas I am studying. This allows me to evolve within a controlled environment, supported by ready-made tools while conducting experiments.

## How to test

Execute the following commands:

- `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`
- `cargo build`
- `cargo run`
